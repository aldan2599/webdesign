<h2 id="limit">Limitations</h2>
<p id="limitinfo"> According to hostingfacts.com, the bandwidth and storage capabilities are non-existent compared to any paid web host provider.
  Since the average uptime is 99.70%, there will be website downtime every other week. This is the best compared to other websites hostingfacts.com has listed.
  But if you need a web host that will be up more frequently and you require more storage, then you will need another web hosting site.
  Hostingfacts.com also warned that 000Webhost.com also suffered a massive security breach in 2015. <br>
  In their Terms and Services, 000Webhost.com says, <br><span class="block">"[your] Site may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions;
  periodic maintenance, repairs or replacements that we undertake from time to time; or causes beyond our reasonable control or that are not reasonably foreseeable including,
  but not limited to, interruption or failure of telecommunication or digital transmission links, hostile network attacks, network congestion or other failures.
  You acknowledge and agree that we have no control over the availability of this Site or the Service on a continuous or uninterrupted basis and that we assume
  no liability to you or any other party with regard thereto."</span>
  <br>Essentially, if your website is lost while they are hosting it, they absolve themselves of culpabilty. Your account may also be suspended if you do not log on once every six months. They also
  waive their responsability for losing any data that your stored with them citing that an external back-up should have been made by the user. Your files cannot contain or install
  .com, .exe, .apk, .dmg, .cmd, .bat, .osx, .msi, and .app. If you experience problems with your site, you are not provided any email or live chat customer support. Your SEO is also limited; just
  hope that you have your own SEO skills to boost your site's visability.<p>
